    <h2>About</h2>
<p> It started with a simple idea; how can we help raise a child. We believe in building a child with personality, a website with a design that communicates and a social media platform that connects.

    Started in 2020 as a simple idea of "now seems a good time to have a baby", the Swissa Grunfeld house embarked on a great covid era project to use their "life is cancelled as we know it" time to create life. Since starting, the Swissa Grunfelds have been creating a messy yet impressive creature, focusing on great content and communication. Today, we are absolutely proud to bring maintain those same core values and he has transformed into a full fledged human. None of this would have been possible without the blood, sweat and tears of the dream team. They sacrificed their time, sanity, peace and money for this project and are now repeating the rewards of a bit more freedom thanks to gan.</p>>
